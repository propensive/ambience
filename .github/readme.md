# Ambience

__Safely access environment variables and system properties__

There are two common methods of passing textual key/value data into a JVM when
it starts: environment variables and system properties. Environment variables
are taken from the shell environment within which the JVM is started, and
usually have uppercase names like `PATH` or `XDG_CONFIG_DIR`, while system
properties are specified as parameters to the `java` command, and have
lowercase or camel-case, period-separated names like `default.log.directory`.
The format of the values of each is dependent on the variable or property, but
a program running on the JVM will have expectations about the format of the
variables and properties it accesses, and it is desirable to parse them into
structured types as early as possible. This is the role of Ambience.

## Features

- typesafe access of environment variables and system properties
- types are inferred for known variables and properties, avoiding strings wherever possible
- concise syntax with idiomatic renaming of environment variables
- complete flexibility to use substitute environments


## Availability







## Getting Started

All Ambience terms and types are in the `ambience` package,
```scala
import ambience.*
````
but are exported to the `soundness` package, which is useful when using
Ambience with other Soundness libraries:
```scala
import soundness.*
```

All other entities are imported explicitly.

### Environment Variables

An environment variable, such as `XDG_DATA_DIRS`, can be accessed by applying
it as a `Text` value, to the `Environment` object, like so:
```scala
import gossamer.t
import environments.jvm
import contingency.strategies.throwUnsafely

val xdgDataDirs = Environment(t"XDG_DATA_DIRS")
```

Note that we import `environments.jvm` because we want to use the environment
from the running JVM. It's possible to use alternative environments, for
example when testing, but normally we want `environments.jvm`.

Environment variables typically use a naming scheme that is incongruous with
other identifiers in Scala. Environment variable names are typically in
uppercase, with multiple words separated by underscores. So an identifier which
would be written `moduleDataHome` in Scala would be written `MODULE_DATA_HOME`
as an environment variable. Ambience can perform this translation
automatically, just by accessing the variable name as a dynamic member of the
`Environment` object, for example,
```scala
val dirs = Environment.moduleDataHome
```
will access the environment variable `MODULE_DATA_HOME`.

If the variable is not defined in the environment, an `EnvironmentError` will
be raised.

It might be reasonably presumed that in the examples above, string values (as
`Text`s) would be returned, and in general this is true, unless the variable is
_known_ in which case, the variable will be parsed into a more appropriate
representation.

For a variable to be _known_, a contextual `EnvironmentVariable` instance,
parameterized on the singleton type of the environment variable's name (in its
camel-case variant) and a result type, must be in scope. For example,
`Environment.columns` (referring to the `COLUMNS` environment variable) will
return an `Int` thanks to the presence of an
`EnvironmentVariable["columns", Int]` typeclass instance, which is provided by
Ambience since `COLUMNS` is a standard POSIX environment variable name.

However, the `moduleDataHome` example above will default to returning a `Text`
value, since no `EnvironmentVariable` instance for the `"moduleDataHome"`
singleton literal type is provided by Ambience.

We can, of course, provide one. The `EnvironmentVariable` trait defines two methods:
- `read`, which takes a `Text` value and returns a parsed value, and
- `name`, which allows custom renamings from "Scala style" names to a
  particular environment variable, with a default implementation that can be
  overridden

Here is an example implementation for a process ID:
```scala
import anticipation.Text
import rudiments.Pid
import spectacular.decodeAs

given EnvironmentVariable["child", Pid] with
  def read(value: Text): Pid = Pid(value.decodeAs[Int])
  override def name: Text = t"CHILD_PID"
```

Now, accessing `Environment.child` will read the `CHILD_PID` environment
variable, parse it as an integer and construct a new `Pid` instance. We could
also omit the override of `name` and just access the value as
`Environment.childPid`.

Note that `value.decodeAs[Int]`, which is provided by
[Spectacular](https://github.com/propensive/spectacular/), and uses a
`Int is Decodable` instance may, given the definition of `Int is Decodable`, fail with
a `NumberError` if the `CHILD_PID` variable contains a value which isn't an
integer. The capability to raise this error will be aggregated into the
`Environment.child` call, ensuring that it will be handled.

#### Custom `Environment`s

Sometimes it is useful to specify a different source of environment variables
than the JVM. This may be because we need to test a method which has been
written to get a value from the environment, but we don't want to introduce the
nondeterminism that arises when running the tests on different machines with
different environments.

Another example presents itself if we want a method call (which takes an
`Environment`) to see different values for certain environment variables, for
example, to ensure that the method accesses an SSH agent with a particular PID,
rather than the SSH agent specified in the `SSH_AGENT_PID` environment
variable, captured when the JVM started.

The `Environment` typeclass defines just a single `apply` method for accessing
environment variables, taking a `Text` value of the environment variable name,
and returning a `Maybe[Text]`, with `Unset` indicating that the environment
variable is not specified. It is distinct from the empty string.

For example, given a `Map[Text, Text]` of environment variables, `vars`, we
could create a new `Environment` with the following `given` definition:
```scala
import vacuous.Unset

val vars = Map(t"HOME" -> t"/home/root")
given Environment = vars.getOrElse(_, Unset)
```

#### Summary

Together, these facilities provide access to environment variables which is
idiomatic (with Scala-style identifiers), typesafe (using checked errors if
parsing fails), concise (types can be inferred) and flexible (allowing
substitution of entire environments).

### System Properties

Support for system properties is provided in much the same way as for
environment variables:
- access is provided through the `Properties` object, by `Text` value or
  dynamic member access
- `systemProperties.jvm` provides the standard system properties from the JVM
- alternative instances of `SystemProperties` can be defined to provide
  substitute values
- `SystemProperty` provides the same functionality as `EnvironmentVariable`
- a `SystemPropertyError` will be raised instead of an `EnvironmentError`

There is no need to rename system properties, since they already follow the
familiar Scala identifier style. Access through the `Properties` object is
slightly different from `Environment`, though: since property names use a
"dotted" format, they can be accessed as dynamic members of the `Properties`
object, for example,
```scala
import systemProperties.jvm

val home = Properties.user.home()
```
or,
```scala
val dir = Properties.db.user.cache.dir()
```
where the empty parentheses are necessary to signal that the path representing
the property name has been specified, and its value should be retrieved. The
retrieval itself works in much the same way as for environment variables.


## Status

Ambience is classified as __fledgling__. For reference, Soundness projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, can still be used,
as long as caution is taken to avoid a mismatch between the project's stability
level and the required stability and maintainability of your own project.

Ambience is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 300 lines of code.

## Building

Ambience will ultimately be built by Fury, when it is published. In the
meantime, two possibilities are offered, however they are acknowledged to be
fragile, inadequately tested, and unsuitable for anything more than
experimentation. They are provided only for the necessity of providing _some_
answer to the question, "how can I try Ambience?".

1. *Copy the sources into your own project*
   
   Read the `fury` file in the repository root to understand Ambience's build
   structure, dependencies and source location; the file format should be short
   and quite intuitive. Copy the sources into a source directory in your own
   project, then repeat (recursively) for each of the dependencies.

   The sources are compiled against the latest nightly release of Scala 3.
   There should be no problem to compile the project together with all of its
   dependencies in a single compilation.

2. *Build with [Wrath](https://github.com/propensive/wrath/)*

   Wrath is a bootstrapping script for building Ambience and other projects in
   the absence of a fully-featured build tool. It is designed to read the `fury`
   file in the project directory, and produce a collection of JAR files which can
   be added to a classpath, by compiling the project and all of its dependencies,
   including the Scala compiler itself.
   
   Download the latest version of
   [`wrath`](https://github.com/propensive/wrath/releases/latest), make it
   executable, and add it to your path, for example by copying it to
   `/usr/local/bin/`.

   Clone this repository inside an empty directory, so that the build can
   safely make clones of repositories it depends on as _peers_ of `ambience`.
   Run `wrath -F` in the repository root. This will download and compile the
   latest version of Scala, as well as all of Ambience's dependencies.

   If the build was successful, the compiled JAR files can be found in the
   `.wrath/dist` directory.

## Contributing

Contributors to Ambience are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like
to look for issues marked
[beginner](https://github.com/propensive/ambience/labels/beginner).

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing
Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of contributing to Ambience
easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

## Name

An _ambience_ is a sense derived from the surrounding environment, and _Ambience_ provides sensible access to the "surrounding environment" of a Scala program.

In general, Soundness project names are always chosen with some rationale,
however it is usually frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its
_uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or catchiness, and there is no
bias towards names with positive or "nice" meanings—since many of the libraries
perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it
should be noted how willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally
of Greek or Latin origin, and have often arrived in English via a romance
language.
